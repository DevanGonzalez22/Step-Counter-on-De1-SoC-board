# Step-Counter-on-De1-SoC-board
Program interacts with the De1-SoC development board’s hardware resources using Linux running on the HPS. Accessed the on-board  ADXL345 accelerometer through the I2C interface and implemented data acquisition in C. The outcome of the lab demonstrates the  integration of embedded Linux, device drivers, and hardware- level data handling.
